More information
The space

We live in an 1895 Victorian top flat with 12 foot ceilings on the best block in San Francisco. Our calendar is always up to date.

Location Location Location~ Our home is close to the Mission, Lower Haight, and 2.5 blocks from the Castro theater. The underground is 3 blocks away, with a street car even closer. The room is small and cosy, but a great price for one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the US!

Please fill out your profile if you are interested~and make sure to arrange a time to meet prior to your arrival, I lead a busy lifestyle, work full time, and wouldn't want to miss anyone! Check in is at 5 and we are 37 steps up from street level.

Restaurants are plentiful and beautiful Dolores Park is quite close. Your room has a twin day bed 75 inches long with a desk and a solid door. The room is 9.25 feet by 8 feet. Amenities include wireless and a gorgeous full kitchen. We have one cat that enjoys company almost as much as we do and a sweet rescue pooch. Our flat gets more light than any other home I've been to in my 13 years of living in this great town.

For all you foodies out there BiRite Creamery, Tartine, Delfina's Pizza and Proper are within 4.5 blocks of our front door. Michelin rated Range is just a few farther.

As much as we love bikes, and we do, we don't have space for storage. If you rent one please return it at the end of the day or lock up on the street at your own risk. Please ask if you would like to have a friend for a short visit.",

Our home is close to public transportation and lots of shops, restaurants and parks. It is near the lively Mission district and quaint Cortland Ave. There is easy access to 80, 101 and 280 if you're driving south or east. Its best for 1 or 2 people, but might be able to accommodate a couple with 1 child. A small dog would be okay, but there is no outdoor area.

The studio is about the size of a small hotel room, with a queen size bed, smart TV you can watch your own streaming service on, breakfast table and chair, a side chair. There is a closet for your use.

The kitchenette includes an under-counter refrigerator, sink, and microwave, as well as an electric kettle and a French press coffee maker. We provide coffee and tea for you to make yourself. There are glasses, mugs, plates and bowls. There is silverware, a can opener, a bottle opener. We provide granola, oatmeal and some light snacks or breakfast items.

The shower and toilet are each behind a wall for privacy, and there is a heavy curtain separating the bathroom from the studio. There is a door for the toilet. However, the bathroom is not a completely separate room, so the studio is best for people who are comfortable with one another.

Our studio is cozy and quiet, and with the curtain pulled to cover the glass entry door, it is quite private. There is no outdoor space. There is a smart TV and you can sign into your own streaming TV service.
